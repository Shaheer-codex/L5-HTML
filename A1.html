                <h3>Seasons</h3>
                <p>Seasons are periods of the year with distinct weather patterns, caused by Earth's axial tilt as it orbits the sun.
                    The
                    four main seasons are spring, summer, autumn (fall), and winter. The tilt causes different hemispheres to receive
                    more
                    or less direct sunlight, leading to opposite seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.</p>
                <p>A season is a period of the year that is distinguished by special climate conditions. The four seasons—spring,
                    summer,
                    fall, and winter—follow one another regularly. Each has its own light, temperature, and weather patterns that repeat
                    yearly. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter generally begins on December 21 or 22.</p>
                <p>Seasons are nature's cyclical ballet, a predictable rhythm driven by Earth's tilt and its orbit around the Sun. They
                    bring a predictable ebb and flow of weather, daylight, and life. Spring awakens the world with blossoming flowers
                    and
                    burgeoning new growth after the dormancy of winter's chill. Summer arrives with long, sun-drenched days, providing
                    warmth and vibrant activity. Autumn then paints the landscape in fiery hues as leaves change color and fall, leading
                    into winter, a period of quiet repose, cold temperatures, and often snow. This continuous cycle ensures renewal and
                    diversity across our planet.</p>
